# Project Name
Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data - NLP assignment using Custom NER and CRF


# General Information
Project background - ‘BeHealthy’, a health tech company, has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organise appointments, track past medical records and provide e-prescriptions.

We have a data set in which a lot of text is written related to the medical domain. There are a lot of diseases that are mentioned in the entire dataset and their related treatments are also mentioned implicitly in the text. We need to determine the disease name and its probable treatment from the dataset by building a custom NER.
